# Topic 2 - Reading and Referencing

## Introduction

And just like that, we are now onto the second research methods topic - "reading and Referencing".

I appreciate some of you may not enjoy reading; however, I hope to change that view - perhaps I am being optimistic!

Reading, can make you smarter (pseudo fact alert); in fact, there is plenty of evidence to suggest a positive correlation between good reading habits, and increased academic performance (see, Owusu-Acheaw, Micheal, and Agatha Gifty, 2014).

Throughout this topic, I intend to show you techniques to quickly read, organise and evaluate academic sources. In doing so, you will be able to construct written arguments that are underpinned by good quality evidence.
