## Introduction

This is a very exciting week as we will now begin the process of traveling long path towards completing your final year project. The goal of this session is to orientate you with the idea of a research question or hypothesis. In doing so, we are going to answer the question:

### How can a I frame my research academically?

<MuiAlert severity="info">
  <AlertTitle>
    <strong> Tip </strong>
  </AlertTitle>
  For assessment 2, I will be looking to see if you have framed your work academically.
  In doing so, you can ensure you get a great grade for this assessment, and set
  a clear forward facing path, moving into your final year. Doing so is important
  as it will allow you to follow the all important scientific method.

## Problem Statement

Before we can dive in and come up with a hypothesis/research question we should have a clearly articulated problem statement (i.e something that our research will address or solve.

A problem statement should:

- Identify an issue
- Reference the problem using the literature
- How the research will address the problem

#### example

Spam is a unfortunate side effect of all forms of electronic communication. This type of communication is not only annoying but also negatively affects productivity. According to a government report the estimated cost to the UK economy caused by spam communication in 2018 was estimated to be two hundred and twenty million (Doe 2017).

This project intends to address the issue of blog comment spam. A spam detection plugin will be made for the popular blogging platform Wordpress. The TensorFlow.js library will be utilised to explore how machine learning can be utilised to solve this problem.

## Research Question and Hypothesis

<MuiAlert severity="info">
  <AlertTitle>
    <strong> Tip </strong>
  </AlertTitle>
  When considering a research question or hypothesis, make sure that you take into
  account that you have a very short period of time to collect data (1 - 2 weeks).
</MuiAlert>

Recall, research is about telling a story. The story begins by painting the broad strokes of situating your research through a problem statement. The research questions/hypothesis focuses in on how your project will be framed and evaluated.

## What Makes A Good Research Question

Many students projects will revolve around a research question. You may recall me stating in the lecture, research questions are exploratory in nature. This lends itself very well to a project where a student is exploring the process of implementing and evaluating some form of artifact.

A good research question should be:

**Specific bounded and answerable**

**bad** - how can a mobile application increase fitness?
**good** - how could the introduction of a social accountability exercise logger increase fitness within a group of 1st year students?

- How can I do/create (or automate doing) X?
- What is a better way to do/create X?
- In what ways can X have impact on the social or physical world
- In what ways can technology X be used The list above is adapted from (Shaw 2003)

Let's consider some concrete examples along with the sort of methods that we could use to answer our research questions.

| Research Question                                                                                                                    | Method                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How can I create a progressive mobile application using Google Firebase in order to assists students and academics with referencing? | Implementation and reflection on process and explanation of how the app was created |
| What is a better way to use technology to assist elderly people access websites?                                                     | Prototype implementation and focus group or interviews held with sample users       |

## What Makes a Good Hypothesis

> > “Hypotheses are single tentative guesses, good hunches – assumed for use in devising theory or planning experiments intended to be given a direct experimental test when possible”. (Eric Rogers, 1966)

Some of you may choose a Hypothesis over a research question, this is absolutely fine however it will somewhat limit the exploratory freedom you have. Whereas a research question is open and probing, a hypothesis is deterministic and measurable.

- Test a measurable outcome such as efficiency/cost
- Efficiency: X is faster, X is more precise

A hypothesis is in effect an educated guess about some measurable outcome such as efficiency. An example hypothesis could be:

**A soft network implementation in a university lab uses less energy than its hardware equivalent**

What is key, is a hypothesis is answered using quantitative measures. Whereas, a research question will be answered using quantitative data.

## Task 1 - Planning a project

<MuiAlert severity="success">
  <AlertTitle>
    <strong> Task 1 - Planning the story</strong>
  </AlertTitle>


As a group prepare pick focus on a single project idea and construct:

- A problem statement, should be underpinned by 1 or 2 citations
- Artifact that will be implemented to solve the problem
- A Research question or hypothesis
- Proposed methods

In your groups, take note of the points above and construct a problem statement, artifact, research question/hypothesis and some proposed methods. Sketch these rough ideas on some form of shared online document that you will be able to present back to the group.

## Student Ideas

To provide you with inspiration for the above task, below are some historic student ideas. These represent projects that were given a range of different grades.

- "As a student with dyslexia, I have personally found it difficult to learn how to code. I have realised through the years that visual learning is the way forward. Associating different images and symbols for the text that has been put in front of me. I want to find a way to make it easier for other people like me in the same position, learning a complex subject like coding, made simple." (Web Development Student 2018)

- "I would like to solve this problem my looking at arears where small to medium sized business could improve their network security. I will address the following questions: What is a network attack? (e.g DDOS), How dangerous can they be? What are the consequences of being exploited? What can be done to prevent them? I will look at case studies to support the readers learning." (Networking Student 2018)

- I will be testing to see whether the e-commerce website www.gourmetdrops.com could generate more traffic and/or sales by optimising the web pages using various UX methodologies.

## A complete plan

Below is a complete plan of what a flowing student project looks like.

### Problem Statement

- In the United Kingdom, it has been estimated that scamming causes up to £10 billion worth of damage every year (Lonsdale et al. 2016). University students in particular are faced with a variety of scams which can have devastating effects (Metzger, Flanagin and Zwarun 2003). If students were made more aware of the latest scamming tactics, they are less likely to be susceptible to the different scams.

### Artifact

- This study explores the use of a PWA to raise student’s awareness about the latest and most common scams that students are faced with

### Research Question

How do students perceive the use of a PWA, specifically push notification, to make them aware of the most common scams?

### Methods

- User think out loud sessions
- Interviews
