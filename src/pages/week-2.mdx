## Introduction

Hello, and welcome to week 2. This week we are going to address an extremely important question:

#### What makes a good final year project?

The answer to this question could have a meaningful impact on, not only this unit but also your final year of studies. While, primarily, we are focusing on a smooth transition into the final year project, much of your assessed work in the final year will be project based. So, in the slightly misquoted words of Ron Burgundy, being able to deliver an good academic project, is “kind of a big deal”. In fact, let’s reframe this question to:

#### How can I deliver a good academic project?

## But wait! Why even do a research project in the first place?

Some of you may be thinking this, and it is actually a good question. To answer it, I briefly want to consider the history of higher education.

Higher education, in its’ current form, can be traced back to 1066 and the university of Bologna. Initially higher education was focused on training a minority of individuals to work in specific careers (e.g., legal and theological).

Universities remained the domain of vocational training until the 1800s. Around this time, the German philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt had a vision that universities should go beyond technically training individuals for specific careers. Instead, they should be researched focused centres of knowledge creation. As such, universities should actively train students in the art of research and knowledge creation. British universities, to this modern day, to varying degrees, follow this model.

While most of you won’t follow a research focused career, Humberbolt argues that:

> > “People obviously cannot be good craftworkers, merchants, soldiers or businessmen unless, regardless of their occupation, they are good, upstanding and – according to their condition well-informed human beings and citizens.” (Humberbolt, cited in Flittner and Giel 1969)

**It is this idea of being a ‘well-informed’ human being that compels us to keep some degree of research orientated focus in a largely vocational degree.**

## How to form a good relationship with your supervisor

</em>

For your final year project, you will be assigned a supervisor. The idea is you work with the supervisor to produce your project. As you can imagine, being able to work well with this supervisor can be helpful!

Above, is a diagram that was formulated by Lyne and Seaman's (2018). The diagram was formulated after interviewing eight undergraduate project supervisors about the type of student-supervisor interactions that lead to a good project experience. As you can see, the focus needs to be on fostering independence, and supporting students to grow in this way.

> > What is key is that you take ownership of your project, and the supervisor acts more like a guide.

They key take away points, from my own experience and the research discussed above it's possible to summarise some key points:

- Always turn up to meetings
- Supervision is guidance, not teaching.
- A supervisor should foster independence and a growth mindset, a student should strive for this

## Choosing a project

It all starts here and trust me when I say “choosing a project is the most important part of the process” – that’s why we are starting now!

With the gravity of the situation established, here are the key points to consider when choosing a project:

> > - Does the project topic interest you?

- Can you align the problem that you are solving to good quality academic sources?
- Does the solution to the problem relate to your degree?
- Will the solution to the problem assist with your future career aspirations?
- Is there a way to attempt to evaluate the degree that your solution solves the problem you specified?

I encourage you to use the above questions as a framework for choosing your project. Currently, you may not be able to answers them all; however, by the end of this module you’ll be able to confidently address them.

In closing this section, I want to reiterate that choosing a project can be tricky. However, try to avoid flitting from one idea to another. Once you have pulled the trigger, try and stick with your idea.

## The overall picture (Presenting your work)

<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/computing-notes/o/images%2Fprocess.png?alt=media&token=e9129393-af8d-4920-9c9f-a3d380f96ff2" />

<em> Figure 3: The scientific process. </em>

Imagine reading a book, or for that matter. With much anticipation you thumb to page one and you are confronted with this:

> > This project is a suggested solution to the problem above stated. Technology and Tourism have worked so well together over the years that make it hard for more local attractions to have a space on the city’s general attraction brochure. It can be the fact that most of them really don’t shelter a huge amount of people nor can be commercialized, but each city has their beauty and small hidden gems that really deserve to be seen by the more curious tourist

Above, is an excerpt from a real project. However, on reading it does not tell me a story of what has been accomplished. Moreover (I like this word!), it is very poorly written. We will work of paragraph, and argument construction in block 3. However, the bigger issue with this project, and others like it, is little has been accomplished in terms of creating a technical artifact and testing the said artifact.

What is key, is the report is reporting on what you have actually done. As supervisors, we are marking you **on what you have done**. As such, the report, must show us a clear story that presents the steps you took to follow the scientific method.

In closing, the story is key when it comes to presenting your project. It's a story of what you have done!

## Task 1 - Accessing Projects

For this task I want you to wear the shoes of a supervisor and try to mark some past projects. In your groups, briefly skim read and discuss the three projects. Next, vote on what you think the marks for each project should be.

First, <a href="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/computing-notes/o/files%2FCDA600_AE2.docx?alt=media&token=b39f6f39-5657-4983-83bb-163edc63b2ce">Look at the marking schema</a>. Then read, and vote on each project.
