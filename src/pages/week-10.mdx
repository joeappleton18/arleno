This week we will be addressing the question:

#### How can I collect qualitative data?

<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/computing-notes/o/images%2Fpop-science.png?alt=media&token=2c5b2329-f835-4ce6-9304-81502090712b" />

<em>Popular science is often underpinned by quantitative studies</em>

I have not always been involved in higher education. For the majority of my adult life, I have lived outside of the walls of higher education. I have, however, always been interested in the process of scientific research - at least on some surface level. The idea of gathering data and using this data to generate new knowledge is fascinating. As such, when I re-entered the world of higher education, I already had preconceived ideas about what constituted good science.

For me, good science was represented by the process of hypothesis testing using large quantitative data sets. I thought that research based on qualitative data was less sophisticated. I believe this perception was moulded through my consumption of pop science - often only based on quantitative studies. Don't get me wrong, I love pop science; it makes research accessible, and this can only be a good thing. My only concern, it supports the idea that social-based research is only looking to develop general universal rules about human behaviour. These rules are neat, tidy and spike a lot of interest.

Take for instance the fantastic [Creating Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/habit-guide), by James Clear. It pulls many examples that draw on quantitative behavioural phycological studies, which have very neat outcomes. Studies such as researchers at Duke University concluding that habits account 40 per cent of our behaviours on any given day. While, in my pre-academic days, I may have taken this fact as absolute. Now, I think - this is just the perspective of a study performed in a never again re-creatable time and space. The point I am trying to make, is humans are messy, irrational and hard to predict. As such, I believe that quantitative data can only tell us part of the story. Often in our research, especially if we only have access to a small sample of individuals, we need a deeper - why? - perspective, that only qualitative data can offer.

## When to use qualitative data

Qualitative data is expressed in words. It is of particular use when we want to access the subjective experiences amd perceptions of a small group of of individuals. As such, qualitative data will normally be used to address an open ended research question:

#### e.g., What are the EXPERIENCES/PERCEPTIONS of GROUP X, in SOME GIVEN SETTING, of SOME PHENOMENON/IDEA/ITEM?

We use the qualitative data to answer our research question.

## How to collect qualitative data

There are many ways to collect qualitative data; however, interviews and focus groups are still most popular methods. As such, I will focus on the mediums of qualitative data collection. These are excellent methods for students that are looking to gain user incites regarding their proof-of-concept applications.

In my experience, I have found qualitative very easy and quick to collect, but hard to analyse. After conducting interviews, I seem to end up vast swathes of data, much of which, cannot be used to address my research question. It's a tricky balance between allowing the conversation to flow, while not going too far off topic.

I have learnt a few techniques that have helped me gather data a little more effectively.

### My top tips to gathering interview/focus group data

Currently, for obvious reasons, we can only collect data online. However, I have actually found this a really effective way to conduct interviews, and I think I will continue conducting interviews in this way. Here are some tips that have helped me along the way:

**Decide on the interview protocol beforehand**, I plan before hand what the interview process is going to look like. I pay specific attention to the questions I am going to ask. While I don't rigidly stick to these questions it does ensure that I have some degree of focus.

**Build ethics into the protocol**, I build into my interview protocol a process of walking the participant through the participant information sheet and also ensuring that they give informed consent to take part in the research. Recently, I have been using [dochub.com](http://dochub.com) to gain signed informed consent - entirely online.

**Use multiple recording devices**, When conducting online interviews, I use the meeting recording feature in Microsoft Teams, and I also use the free audio recording software [Quick Time](https://quicktime.en.softonic.com/mac) as a secondary recording method

**Start recording discretely**, Nothing kills a relaxed mood more than saying, "right, I am now starting to record this interview". As part of my protocol, when I go over the participant information, I ensure that the participant understands that the interview is recorded. However, I always discretely start recording.

**Back up your recording**, I use an external [hard drive](https://www.amazon.co.uk/LaCie-Portable-Resistant-External-LAC301558/dp/B0058VIWTM/ref=asc_df_B0058VIWTM/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310843013710&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1846284012902740467&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=2826&hvtargid=pla-316724739574&psc=1&th=1&psc=1) to back up all of my interview data.

## How to analyse qualitative data

### Transcribe

**Get the data into a analysable format**

First and foremost, you will need to get the data into a format that you allows you to conduct analysis. I like to transcribe the data and I have toyed with multiple ways of doing this:

- Paying a transcriber, this is fairly pricey.
- Fully transcribing myself, this is very time consuming.

I have found the best technique for me is using an automated transcription tool. I use [otter.ai/](https://get.otter.ai/) to do a very quick transcription of the audio data. Next, I re-listen to the interview - but I slow it down to about 50% speed. As it plays, I manually correct any errors in the automated transcription. This has the added bonus of re-familiarising myself with the data.

### Analysing the data

<em> The Process of Thematic Analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006). </em>

The most widely used method to analyse qualitative data it thematic analysis. This is the process of drawing themes and patterns out of the data.

One of the critiques of qualitative based studies is the analysis that has been presented is often hard to replicate. A consequence, it's also very hard to understand, as a beginner researcher, how you might go about conducting thematic analysis. Virginia Braun & Victoria Clarke have done an excellent job of addressing this issue in their widely cited paper, "Using thematic analysis in psychology". [I strongly recommend reading this paper to familiarise yourself with the process of thematic analyse](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/computing-notes/o/files%2Fusing_thematic_analysis_in_psychology.pdf?alt=media&token=dfdb4a51-c2bd-4dd1-aeb9-307afcf93760). Within it, they outline the process of:

- Creating codes
- Using thematic analysis in psychology
- Create themes by bringing the codes together
  lace the themes into a hierarchy

Questions

Is this a well constructed study? Consider the sample size and interview protocol.

Pay attention to how they have reported on their themes. Is it clear, though, how these themes were constructed?
