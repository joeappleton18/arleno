## Introduction

This week, we look at how you can avoid academic misconduct. Specifically, we will focus on how you can correctly use the work of others to underpin your ideas. We will be addressing the following question:

#### How can I use good quality evidence to underpin my academic work, while ensuring academic integrity and good ethics?

#### What is academic integrity?

[I am sure you have read the student academic misconduct policy document; yes, such a document exists](https://staff.solent.ac.uk/official-documents/quality-management/academic-handbook/2l-student-academic-misconduct-policy.pdf). The policy outlines four areas of misconduct which you should be aware of: plagiarism, collusion, falsification and replication.

Plagiarism and collusion are the most common forms of academic misconduct and can result in a referral to the academic misconduct panel.

- **plagiarism.** Where the student passes off someone else's ideas or work their own. This can be one of the most serious forms of academic misconduct, akin to fraud. It should be noted that outsourcing your work, or getting a third party to do it for you is also plagiarism.

- **collusion.** Where the student/s in the same cohort knowingly allows their work to be viewed by another student and this work is subsequently incorporated in, or represented as, this students work.

Further examples of academic misconduct include falsification and replication, and could, in theory, see you referred to academic misconduct. However, in reality, you will probably just loose marks, or have to re-submit the assessment in the referral period, capped at 40%.

Now that the possible breaches of academic integrity have been defined. Let's briefly explore why universities take academic integrity so seriously. To understand, these ideas, we firstly need to consider what a university is.

## Why Academic Integrity is Serious

Post 19th century, we saw a marked change in universities. They gradually transformed from places teaching rigid bodies of knowledge dictated by the church and the state to institutions that actively create new knowledge. This reform can be credited to Wilhelm von Humboldt who invented the modern research university.

> > Man is born to inquire and create. And when a man or a child chooses to inquire or create out of his own free choice, then he becomes in his own terms an artist rather than a tool of production or a well-trained parrot. - Humboldt

The idea of knowledge creation is the key difference between university and college/six form. A role of a lecturer in a given university is ,in part, to create new knowledge. This is the fundamental difference, between a teacher and a lecturer. A a teacher delivers a state-provided body of knowledge and does not necessarily have the academic freedom to add this knowledge based. Rather, in higher education, there is a culture of knowledge creation. As such, passing off other people's ideas as your owm is at odds with the values that higher education holds dear.

Now we have defined the role of universities, we can move on to how we can base our ideas on the knowledge university system creates.

## Referencing

Currently, academic journals are our main mechanism for sharing and advancing science. Journal articles, will be one of your highest quality sources.

When we base our work on a given source, journals or otherwise, it is important to credit this source. Beyond, just avoiding plagiarism, referencing can add credibility to your work - pushing up your grade. Further to this it:

- shows the depth and quality of your research
- shows awareness of what’s already been done in the area
- shows awareness of what’s already been done in the area
- backs up your arguments and justify the points made – give them validity

### Harvard Referencing System

[Solent uses the Harvard Referencing system](https://libguides.solent.ac.uk/ld.php?content_id=32039810).

While many different referencing systems exist, Harvard is the most popular. Harvard is just a baseline standard, and it can differ by institution. [Solent have developed their own referencing system based on Harvard](https://libguides.solent.ac.uk/ld.php?content_id=32039810). You should ensure you read the Solent referencing guide in full, I will not cover it in this article. Instead, let us consider a few ways of how you can effectively use referencing.

<MuiAlert severity="info">
  <AlertTitle>
    <strong> Tip </strong>
  </AlertTitle>
  Always try and summaries other peoples work. Avoid picking small sections of a
  given study, and re-writing in your own words. Such an approach is not representative
  of the actual study.
</MuiAlert>

### A single source

There are two ways attribute work:

#### Examples

- Appleton (2018) concluded, after conducting in-depth interviews with 20 second-year computing students, that students largely struggle to learn functional programming.
- It has been argued that students struggle to learn functional programming (Appleton 2018).

### Multiple Sources

Using multiple sources can be an excellent way to show that there is a widespread agreement with the point that you are trying to argue.

#### Examples

- Decreasing mental health within the HE system is a growing issue and can be used to explain the increasing attrition rates among undergraduate university students (Appleton 2018; Reid 2009; Muskett, 2015)

### Direct Quotation

A direct quotation is when you is when you use a block of text directly from a source. Watch out for this one, I often see students omitting the page number. Also, use these types of quotations sparingly, its normally better to summarise third-party work.

#### Examples

- Make sure you put a page number in" (Appleton 2013, p.10)
- Appleton (2013, p.10) says, "Make sure you put a page number in"

## Ethics

Ethics comes down to common sense. Solent have constructed a simple ethical framework that you should follow:

1.  [For all research, you need to complete an ethics form.](https://ethics.app.solent.ac.uk/)
2.  [Before conducting research with human participants, you must ensure they "consent" to participate. Consent means participants are aware of what's in store for them and have every opportunity to withdraw from the research. Participants give their consent by signing an informed consent form.](https://www.solent.ac.uk/research-innovation-enterprise/documents/informed-consent-form.pdf)

## Task 1 - Ethics

<MuiAlert severity="success">
  <AlertTitle>
    <strong> Task 1 - Using your ethical criticality </strong>
</AlertTitle>


You need to be able to use your own judgment as to what is ethical.

[In your groups, read the following article and answer the highlighted question regarding ethics](./readings/experimental-evidence-of-massive-scale-emotional-contagion-through-social-networks)

</MuiAlert>


## Task 2 - Plagiarism and Ethics

<MuiAlert severity="success">
  <AlertTitle>
    <strong> Task 2 - Plagiarism and Ethics </strong>
  </AlertTitle>


The purpose of this session's task is to, in your groups, help us build a collaborative resource that can be used to help second year computing and networking students avoid plagiarism.

Within your project groups, you should conduct research and provide advice, guidance, information and tips about how other students can avoid plagiarising. You should share this advice on the padlet link provided by your tutor.

**You should be as useful, practical and creative as possible.**

This is a beneficial activity to undertake because you must first understand, and become familiar with, what is meant by plagiarism before you can offer advice to others.

Consider discussing and sharing the following points:

- Understand what is meant by plagiarism and what it covers
- Use the correct referencing procedure
- What are block quotes?
- Think about plagiarism in relation to social media or tweeting
- Is paraphrasing plagiarism?
- What's the difference between summarising and paraphrasing?
