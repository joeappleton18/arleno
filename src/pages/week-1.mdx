## Introduction

It all starts here! The idea goal of this unit is not to turn you all into researchers - although, that would be a nice bonus. This week I will introduce you to this unit, and how it feeds into your final year project. Further to this, we consider what scientific research is.

We will be framing this week through the following questions:

1.  What assessments do I need to complete?
2.  What does it mean to be a graduate?
3.  What is research?
4.  What is reality and how might I access this reality when conducting my research?

    <strong> Task 1 - Forming Teams</strong>
  </AlertTitle>
  
   For this first task, we are going to form teams for assessment 1.
   Don't worry, the team work will be fairly informal and only counts towards 20% of the unit.

It's my pleasure to welcome you to this introductory module in research methods üòÅ ! My goal for this module is simple, yet challenging, I want to make your final year project great! This will ensure that you get a high grade in, not only this unit, but your final year project. A nobel goal, considering that the project is worth a high percentage of your final year, you can make a real difference to your grade classification.

While grades are important, I am going to let you in on as secret, as a lecture I don't actually care too much about grades - or perhaps more aptly, grades are not my focus. To overly focus on grades distracts from the underlying learning that needs to take place in order to achieve a high grade. Instead of trying to get you I high grade; instead, my focus is imparting you with vital life skills, "a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career". The overarching of which is to make you think like a graduate.

<br />
<br />

"**Graduates¬†are¬†thought¬†to¬†feel¬†a¬†need¬†to¬†seek¬†and¬†evaluate¬†evidence¬†before¬†coming¬†to¬†a¬†conclusion,¬†not¬†to¬†accept¬†‚Äòspin‚Äô¬†as¬†readily¬†as¬†non-graduates,¬†to¬†question¬†the¬†status¬†quo to¬†show¬†intellectual¬†curiosity¬†about¬†the¬†social¬†world**"

> > Biggs¬†2011,¬†p.111

<br />

In summary, should we succeed and get you to think like a graduate, high grades will follow. While I appreciate your primary focus is on achieving high grades, the skills I teach you on this unit go beyond the university context and will follow you for life. University, is all about, "giving you the courage to use your own understanding"

## Task 1 - What it means to be a graduate

    <strong> Task 1 - What it means to be a graduate</strong>
  </AlertTitle>
  
   <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/CCREAD/etscc/kant.html">
    Depending on time, we may or may not do this task in class. However, I highly recommend you skim read Immanuel Kant's essay on what it means to be enlightened.
    </a>


This essay was written over 200 years ago; however, it captures the idea of mature enlightened thinking. It's a challenging read; however, it it captures the idea of what it means to be an informed next-level thinker.

"Laziness and cowardice are the reasons why such a large part of mankind gladly remain [immature] all their lives, long after nature has freed them from external guidance [...]. It is so comfortable to be a [immature]. If I have a book that thinks for me, a pastor who acts as my conscience, a physician who prescribes my diet, and so on--then I have no need to exert myself. I have no need to think."

You need not fear, this unit will teach you how to think in an informed way!

## What even is research?

The answer to this question is not straightforward as it depends on the given context. For instance, you probably regularly conduct research in you day-to-day. If you've ever waded through IMDB and rotten tomatoes before investing time in watching a movie, then you've conducted research; however, while this is indeed research, this is not what we consider scientific research (the sort of research you will need to conduct for your project).

### Scientific Research

Scientific research is the means of generating new knowledge through a systematic process. This systematic process must be underpinned by the scientific method (more about this later). The hope is that by following the scientific method you research will be:

- Reliable
- Repeatable
- Valid

Viewing research through the lense of a scientific method can be somewhat of a simplification - like life, research rarely goes to plan. However, I believe it can be a useful tool to frame a generalised route that you will take on the journey towards completing your final year project.

## Computing scientific method

> > Figure 2, a rough representation of how scientific method will be applied to your final year project.

Above, is the process that we will be, roughly following. Don't worry if the entire process seems daunting. We spread it over two years, and work on small chunks at a time. This year, we are looking into the exploration and planning phases.

## We need to make a philosophical assumption

How you believe knowledge can exist within your given area of inquiry will frame your research approach.

### Measuring Reality

For instance, you may believe that your research project will generate data that can be easily numerically measured. Programs, algorithms, network implementations and applications that are implemented with the view to evaluate efficiency have a simple measurable outcome (e.g, space, memory usage, time or even cost). If we are to take this approach, we are acknowledging that there is an external reality that is objective and measurable. However, things are not always this clear.

### Can Reality be Measured?

For instance, many students develop some sort of software application for their final year project. This software is intended to solve some problem (e.g, health, productivity). These products are to serve a given base, and one can argue that the value of these products are a conscience construction of these users - which can't be measured. Instead, we must evaluate our projects through accessing the users' perception of our work. This is easier than it sounds, we could use techniques such as interviews, focus groups or qualitative surveys.

### Task 2 - What is our reality

    <strong> Task 2 - Is there such a things as an objective reality, or, does it depend?</strong>

Form groups and discuss the following ideas:

<AnswerQuestionDialog
  question={
    "Is there such a things as an objective reality, or, does it depend?"
  }
  id={questionIDs.find((q) => q.count === 1).id}
>
   <p>Is there a reality that exists beyond that is constructed beyond human
  conscious?  </p>
<p>
  Behavioral psychology, or behaviorism, is a theory suggesting that environment
  shapes human behavior. Therefore, we are independent of our environment. To
  what extent do you believe this to be true?

## Reading

### Kant on enlightenment and revolution

The moral of this essay is dare to be original, think for yourself. It talks of obtaining freedom through knowledge. All universities, should subscribe to this notion, and instill students with such freedoms.

I recommend you read the first three paragraphs, and let the message occupy your mind throughout your time at university

[Foucault, M., 1986. Kant on enlightenment and revolution. Economy and Society, 15(1), pp.88-96.](http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/web%20publishing/KantOnElightenment.htm)
