# Course Overview

You'll all know me from technical modules such as databases and interaction design. These technologies have provided me, and will also equip you, with many freedoms. Possessing the ability to create high-quality digital products is a valuable currency. As such, it has been nothing but a privilege to teach you these applied skills. However, as valued as these skills are, I see this module as my most important, teaching-related, work!

## So, what's this research methods module about then?

I appreciate most of you have no aspirations to pursue post-graduate study and become researchers. However, contrary to the name, this module is not about training you to become a researcher; rather, it's about empowering you to become a scholar practitioners. 

A scholar-practitioner is a professional who combines academic research skills with the practical experience of a practitioner. In other words, they can operationalise research rigour into their everyday lives and practice. 

### Right, but how are you going to do this?

Well, first, we are going to define what scientific research is. You'll carry this knowledge into your final year and apply it to get a high grade in your final year project. More importantly, though, I want to equip you with the skills to be an independent and critical thinker. To, as Kant would say (more about him later), "use one's reason, intellect, and wisdom without the guidance of another." Further to this, I want to give you the skills to create clear and logical written arguments - that make sense. In summary, being a scholar-practitioner critical thinker and communicator are the real skills this module provides - skills that you will be able to fall back on for life.

### Ok, but how are you going to assess me?

This module is all about slowing things down and sharing ideas - sometimes controversial divisive ones. There will be lots of structured group discussion, and the first assessed piece of work will require you to submit a group presentation (don't worry, it's only worth 20% of the final grade). Assessment 2 (80%), written in an academic style, will require you to develop your research interests and develop a research proposal, acting as a foundation for your final year project.

In summary, I am confident that this module can give you a fresh new perspective, to at least consider. However, you get out what you put in. Some people will think these skills are not directly applicable to their career aspirations; therefore, they are not worth learning. However, they're missing the point that a university education is about teaching them to become a next-level thinker and communicator. You can make a choice, right now, to maintain an open mind - you never know, you might learn something. Or you could do just enough to pass the assessments and miss out on the opportunity to see the world through a new perspective. **The choice is that simple, and it is totally up to you.**
