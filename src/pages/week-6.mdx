## Introduction

Within higher education, terms such as critical thinking or critical analysis are thrown around with disregard. They adorn unit descriptors, marking rubrics and are peppered across assessment feedback. These ideas are indeed vital skills that every graduate, regardless of the study area, should possess. However, up until this point, the reality of what these concepts mean may be hazy at best. If you feel this way, you are in good company; according to Moon (2017), even academics cannot decide on a common definition. There are, however, common ideas that we can agree upon. This week, we will be attempting to answer the question:

#### What is critical thinking?

In doing so, we will we will explore the definition of critical thinking and its importance in various academic and professional contexts. We will also discuss the skills required for critical thinking, including the ability to analyse information, challenge ideas, and arrive at considered conclusions. By the end of this session, you will have a deeper understanding of what critical thinking is and how it can be applied in your academic and professional pursuits.

## Task 0 - A critical thinking thought experiment

Welcome to this warm-up activity on critical thinking! In this task, you will be presented with a scenario and asked to analyse it based on the facts presented. Remember, critical thinking involves thoughtful and meaningful consideration of information to arrive at a considered conclusion. This skill is essential in both academic and professional contexts, and we will explore it further in this session. Let's begin!

### The Scenario

A judge tells a condemned prisoner that, “he will be hanged at noon on one weekday in the following week but that the execution will be a surprise to the prisoner.”. He will not know the day of the hanging until the executioner knocks on his cell door at noon that day.

#### Having reflected on his sentence, the prisoner draws the conclusion that he will escape from the hanging. However, he is hung, by surprise, on noon Wednesday. 

#### How did the prisoner construct this logical argument?

#### What are the potential flaws?


## Task 1 - Defining Critical Thinking 

In this task, you will be presented with different definitions of critical thinking and asked to rate them based on how well they align with your understanding of the concept.

## Do not believe everything you read

In this section, we consider how we can hone our criticality by considering the quality of sources!

[Take, for example, following headline appearing in a widely read 2017 Huffington Post article](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/computing-notes/o/images%2Fwine_article.0a2b4297.png?alt=media&token=56d1ec7f-51fc-46f5-96a1-3fc2953f0e3e): Should we be ditching the gym in place of a glass of wine? - Well, unsurprisingly, and perhaps sadly, no!

It turns out, this article is based on the outcomes of a study by University of Alberta researcher - Dr Jason Dyck (2012). The small-scale study presented findings a compound, known as resveratrol, found in nuts, some fruits and red wine enhanced the effect exercise in rats. The reality of the study is very different than the Huffington Post article suggests. However, I suspect, the actual title of the original research paper, would not have generated much in the way of social media buzz. While you may only need limited critical skills to judge the validity of the previously mentioned article it is not always so simple to make a critical judgement about the validity of the information at hand.

As a second example, consider a study by Andrew Wakefield concluding there is a link between the onset of autism and bowel disease with the MMR vaccination. These findings were presented in one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals - the Lancet. The results were heavily reported by mainstream news sources and lead to a decline in adults getting their children vaccinated. However, the work was later discredited and redacted. On further exploration of the paper, it is very clear why. There is a lack of a comparison group; and the sample size consisted, of a tiny, 12 children and is non-random. Nonetheless, this worked passed the peer-review process and convinced many mainstream media outlets to report on it. It is my goal, in this unit, to equip you with the critical skills to be able to make an informed judgment on work such as this yourself. Such a skill, by many, is considered the difference between graduates and non-graduates.

The ideas of what it means to be a graduate varies. However, a definition that I work towards was proposed by Biggs 2011:

> > "Graduates are thought to feel a need to seek and evaluate the evidence before coming to a conclusion, not to accept ‘spin’ as readily as non-graduates, to question the status quo, to show intellectual curiosity about the social world" (Biggs 2011, p.111)

In summary, we will be working towards equipping you with an ever-increasing mental tool kit to enable critical thinking. As I hope I have demonstrated this is an important life skill. In time, you will be able to take ideas, evaluate them and use them to create new knowledge.

Finally, I would like to introduced a useful framework for evoking critical thinking.

## A critical thinking framework

  style={{ width: "900px" }}

There are several frameworks created to help students with critical thinking. On of my favorite is the above framework created by Aveyard (2007). The framework asks six key questions that are intended to trigger critical thinking. Although Aveyard's book targets health and social care students, the principles still apply across any given topic area.


## Task 2 - Video games make you less smart!

    <strong> Task 2  - Can video games make you less smart </strong>
  </AlertTitle>
  
  Students love to make apps to help with procrastination. Along with depression, it's by far the most common project conducted. 
  
  In this task, we are going to critically analyse a paper that links game usage to, essentially, procrastination.

, it is a wild claim, but reality is it based on?

Within your groups, see if you can locate, read and discuss the original research paper that this article was based on.
