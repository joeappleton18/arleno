## Introduction

Hemmingway famously said, "The first draft of anything is s\*\*t.". Yet, I suspect that often students submit their first draft. This is a great shame as often high-quality work is hidden behind a poorly constructed final report. This week, I will share a few tips and techniques that can go a long way in improving your writing. As such, we are going to be addressing the question:

#### How can I edit and proofread my work to make it awesome?

<MuiAlert severity="info">
  <AlertTitle>
    <strong> A quick aside </strong>
  </AlertTitle>


First, a quick point. You only go through this re-drafting process for your more formal pieces of work. While aspects of this process can be incorporated into your everyday lives, you need to find a balance. For instance, these notes are informal - I don't stringently edit them. That's why you'll find typos. However, if I am writing in an academic or business capacity, I follow a more stringent editing process.

Also, before we move on, I should say that if you are constructing your reports the day of the deadline - all bets are off. I am assuming, though, at least some of you do not follow the "due data do date" mantra.

## Drafting your work

<img width="900" src="https://postgraduateresearcher.com/content/images/2021/10/drafting-process.drawio.png" />

This week, I want to look at writing as a process. This process is personal to you - we all work differently. In this article, I want to look at a high-level writing process that guides me from a s\*\*\*t to a polished draft. Sharing it may inspire you to think about developing your writing process.

### 1. First draft (S\*\*t draft)

The first draft, sometimes known as the s\*\*t draft or vomit draft, is all about getting the momentum of writing started. For me, it's about beginning to structure my ideas into some form of flow and narrative. I aim for about 500 - 1000 words a day, and it's a messy scrappy process. I don't proofread or edit at this stage. I am focused on using my writing to structure, my usually jumbled, ideas.

### 2. Redraft (Rough draft)

At this stage, I have a sh\*\*t draft. It has served the purpose of getting my ideas down in one place. The redraft phase involves reorganising and rewriting, so things make sense. At this stage, I don’t edit - that comes next; rather, I am focused on the overarching structure and narrative of the writing. I address the following question:

- Does the writing follow a somewhat logical flow?

### 3. Broad edit (Rough draft 2)

At this stage, I have a rough draft, and my ideas are formed. However, these ideas may be clear to an individual with no knowledge of the project my work reads them. This stage ensures that the writing follows a logical flow. I normally aim to edit around 1,000 - 2,000 words a day..

Addressing the following questions can really help:

- Do the topic sentences of each paragraph capture a single idea and link to form a logical flow and story (some people call this a reverse outline)?
- Do the headings, when viewed on the contents page, form a logical flow?
- When considering my work from the perspective of a third-party reader, have I made any assumptions in assumed knowledge about my project?
- What figures do I need to include to support my writing?
- Have I repeated the same point more than once?

This is perhaps the most mentally demanding stage, as addressing the above questions is no easy undertaking. However, at the end of this stage, a major milestone has been reached. You have some work that logically flows, the final two stages are about polishing the work.

### 4. Narrow edit (Near Clean Draft)

The work is now well structured and we are now in the editing phase. The purpose of the narrow edit is to focus on the paragraph and sentence level. When trying to edit your own work, your mind tricks you into overlooking grammatical errors and mistakes. Ideally, you should therefore try to leave your work for some time before the edit. However, we are all under tight time constraints and this is not always possible. I, therefore, try to change my perspective of the work. To achieve this, I work on a single paragraph at a time. I copy the paragraph in focus into a separate word document. To ensure the document looks different from my actual work, I set the font to Comic Sans 30 points. and the page colour to yellow.

I then:

- Read the paragraph out loud and make grammatical and syntactical improvements.
- I also use Microsoft Word’s read-aloud functionality set at a slow speed. I close my eyes and listen to the spoken narrative, ensuring that it makes sense.
- I cut out redundant sections.
  Check if I’ve repeated the same point twice.
- I ensure the paragraph is as succinct as possible. You must be brutal; there is no place for waffling in academic writing.
- I ensure the references are correct.

### Proof Read (Clean draft)

At this stage, I have a near clean draft that is grammatically correct. All figures and references are in place, and now it is just a case of giving the work final proofreading. I proofread a 1000 word section of work at a time. As with editing, the key is changing perspective - otherwise, you won’t spot errors. Along with changing the font and background colour, I read the work backwards. This disorientates the familiar perspective that I have formed with the work.

Proofreading can be quick. I normally average about 10’000-words a day. By the end, I have my clean draft, and it’s time to pass it around to colleagues and supervisors for feedback.

### Considering the flow of your project

| Section                | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Introduction           | This should pull together, and summarise, the entire project. At this point, want to define the problem statement and how your artifact solves the problem.    |
| Methodology            | Shows how the artifact was managed and created and evaluated. The evaluation should allow you to determine to what extent you've solved the problem statement. |
| Results and Conclusion | Should use the results as evidence to bring the work to a close by making a claim as to the extent that the problem statement was closed                       |

<em> Table 1 - The logical flow of a project </em>

The above table is, of course a simplification. However, it highlights that there must be a logical flow across your work. You should check:

- Does the introduction summarise the project?
- Does the body of the report support the conclusions?
- Do the conclusions provide me with what was promised in the introduction?

You can look at your work of as a story, one that tells a tail of scientific method. While I know this sounds a little boring, it will go a long way in articulating the work that you have done.

</em>

Following the above points should, in theory, ensure that your overarching logical structure is correct. However, you still need to check on a paragraph level. Recall from last week the each paragraph must make a clear and single point - captured in the topic statement. A rule of thumb is if you extract the first sentence from each paragraph and line them up, there should be a clear logical flow. You should also consider the following points:

- Are the paragraph the correct length (100 - 200 words for academic paragraphs)?
- Does the paragraph include a topic sentence?
- Does the body of the paragraph support the idea expressed in the topic sentence?
- Does each paragraph link to the next?

## Task 1 - Make a editing check list

Proof reading is more simplistic than editing. At this stage, you are happy with your final draft and are checking for spelling, typos and grammatical errors.

It is hard to find errors in our own work. A tip is to try and change the perspective of how you comprehend your text. For instance, when I self proof read, I tend to treat each paragraph as independent units. I extract the paragraphs, one at a time, and place them in a word document. I set the background to yellow, zoom in 3x and use the read aloud function in word - this tends to find most errors. As a final measure, I always get a third party to read over my work.

## Task 2 - Construct a list of proof reading tips and tools
