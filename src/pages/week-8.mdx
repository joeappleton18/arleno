## Introduction

Hemmingway famously said "The first draft of anything is s\*\*t.". Yet, I suspect that often students submit their first draft. This is a great shame as often high-quality work is hidden behind a poorly constructed final report. This week I am going to share with you a few tips and techniques that can go a long way in improving your writing. As such we are going to be addressing the question:

#### How can I edit and proof read my work and make it awesome?

<MuiAlert severity="info">
  <AlertTitle>
    <strong> A quick aside </strong>
  </AlertTitle>


First, a quick point. You only go through this re-drafting process for your more formal pieces of work. However, aspects of this process can be incorporated into your everyday lives. For instance, these notes and fairly informal - I don't stringently edit them (hence you'll find some typos).

Also, before we move on, I should say that if you are constructing your reports the day of the deadline - all bets are off. I am assuming, though, at least some of you do not follow the "due data do date" mantra.

## Drafting your work

I agree with the ideas of Azariadis (2017), who states that the re-drafting process can be split into **editing** and **proof reading**. Both of these activities take place at different in the writing process.

**editing.** is the process of reading and redrafting. You are trying to insure the logical flow of your work.

**proof reading.** takes place after the edit and aims to identify typos, spelling and punctuation errors.

## Editing

### Checking the argument

When communicating in a formal style (e.g., science, work and university) , forming a written or verbal argument is a common way to share ideas. However, it is important to understand that an academic argument differs from the more common emotionally charge disputes that we normally associate with the term argument.

In an academic argument you are trying to convince the reader of a given conclusion through the use of supporting evidence. This is your over arching argument; however, as we explored last week you are also making arguments on a paragraph level. In summary, a high-level report will fit together paragraph level arguments into a logical flow that forms an overarching arguments.

So far, I have been a little abstract, let's consider a more concrete example. For your, final year project you need to create and evaluate an artifact. Your argument will flow something like this:

| Section                | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Introduction           | This should pull together, and summarise, the entire project. At this point, want to define the problem statement and how your artifact solves the problem.    |
| Methodology            | Shows how the artifact was managed and created and evaluated. The evaluation should allow you to determine to what extent you've solved the problem statement. |
| Results and Conclusion | Should use the results as evidence to bring the work to a close by making a claim as to the extent that the problem statement was closed                       |

<em> Table 1 - The logical flow of a project </em>

The above table is, of course a simplification. However, it highlights that there must be a logical flow across your work. You should check:

- Does the introduction summarise the project?
- Does the body of the report support the conclusions?
- Do the conclusions provide me with what was promised in the introduction?

You can look at your work of as a story, one that tells a tail of scientific method. While I know this sounds a little boring, it will go a long way in articulating the work that you have done.

</em>

Following the above points should, in theory, ensure that your overarching logical structure is correct. However, you still need to check on a paragraph level. Recall from last week the each paragraph must make a clear and single point - captured in the topic statement. A rule of thumb is if you extract the first sentence from each paragraph and line them up, there should be a clear logical flow. You should also consider the following points:

- Are the paragraph the correct length (100 - 200 words for academic paragraphs)?
- Does the paragraph include a topic sentence?
- Does the body of the paragraph support the idea expressed in the topic sentence?
- Does each paragraph link to the next?

Proof reading is more simplistic than editing. At this stage, you are happy with your final draft and are checking for spelling, typos and grammatical errors.

It is hard to find errors in our own work. A tip is to try and change the perspective of how you comprehend your text. For instance, when I self proof read, I tend to treat each paragraph as independent units. I extract the paragraphs, one at a time, and place them in a word document. I set the background to yellow, zoom in 3x and use the read aloud function in word - this tends to find most errors. As a final measure, I always get a third party to read over my work.
