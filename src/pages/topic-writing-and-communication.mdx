# Topic  - Writing and Communication

## Introduction

Welcome to topic 3 - writing and communication. In this topic, we will be looking at how to communicate clearly and effectively. While we will be, primarily, focused on written communication. The tips and tricks that you'll learn can also be used when you verbalise your ideas (e.g, assessment 1).

Improving your writing skills and being able to communicate ideas is a vital life skill. However, I have found that many students struggle with these skills. It is my hope that this topic will set you of the trajectory towards becoming a confident and authoritative writer.
