## Introduction

I hope that you agree, communicating clearly and with authority is a vital life skill. However, it is a skill that rarely taught. Also, I have noticed, over time, my students' writing skills have dropped in standard. This may not be surprising, as the majority of your written communication is probably informal (e.g., social media and short messages). I love informal communication; however, it is important to be able to communicate across the spectrum of formality. I know this, as prior to starting my second career as a lecture, I rarely wrote anything formal. I convinced myself that as long as I could be understood, there was little need to worry about writing authoritatively with style and form. Since transitioning back into academia, I have had to learn the skill of crafting well written pieces of work; and I now realise that this skill would have aided me greatly in my pre-university career. As now, I can confidently construct written arguments, and circulate them to whoever can be bothered to read them.

This week I am going to be exploring with you some quick tips that I have learnt over the last 5 years that can drastically improve the quality of your writing. In doing so we are going to be addressing the question:

### How can I construct, clear and concise, written academic arguments?

After this week, you should understand what it means to communicate with clarity. While we will focus on the academic style of writing, the basic tenets can be applied to any form of authoritative writing (e.g., emails, proposals, CVs and Linked in Profiles).

## Styles of Writing

You may or may not be aware, that there are different styles of writing. Primarily, in your day-to-day life, you'll be exposed to different flavours of journalistic writing (e.g, news, blogs and advertising copy). This styled of writing uses short punchy sentences and paragraphs. The goals is to draw the readers in with attention grabbing titles, images and headlines. You'll often find that the paragraphs and sentences used are short and punchy - to quickly convey information. For instance, it is common to see one sentence paragraphs:

> > As Australia prepares to begin the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, state health departments, including SA Health and Queensland Health, were unable to post.

Academic, writing on the other hand, consists of longer paragraphs. The reason for this is statements made must be underpinned by evidence. Let's explore this idea by first considering paragraphs in general, then move on to frame them more academically.

## Tha Paragraph

If you liken writing, to building a house - paragraphs would be the building bricks. When crafting your writing they act as the key unit of composition. So, you may have gathered that the paragraph is one of the most important tools in your writing arsenal. However, I have noticed that many people make some fundamental mistakes; however, this can easily be avoided. Unlike much of the English language, paragraphs follow a very simple rule:

> > Each paragraph consists of a single idea.

The concept that each paragraph represents a single - self contained - idea is a fundamental truth of all writing styles. This idea is captured in a single sentence, normally at the start paragraph, known as the **topic sentence**. If you were writing informally (e.g., blogging  and email). A topic sentence can stand alone as a single sentence paragraph. However for the paragraphs that underpin your main academic arguments we need to take things a little further.

## The Academic Paragraph

<em> Figure 1, an example of how to construct academic paragraphs </em>

We've already established that a paragraph, as a minimum, should have a topic sentence. However, in academic writing it is generally not enough for a topic sentence to stand alone by itself - this is especially the case if the paragraph is important. Academic paragraphs should consist of three key parts:

1.  Topic sentence - expresses the key idea
1.  Evidence - Supports/elaborates/explains the topic sentence
1.  Concluding Sentence - concludes the paragraph, should link back to the topic sentence

While each paragraph should make a stand alone point, there should be a logical flow between paragraphs. This is achieved through linking the concluding sentence to the topic sentence of the next paragraph; or, if the wider idea is transitioning, you can use a signposting sentence before the topic sentence.

A clear sign that you are writing cohesive paragraphs is by reading the first sentence of each paragraph in isolation. If there is a clear flow you are achieving a very high level of writing.

## Language Style

It's important we consider the audience we are writing for and adjust our language accordingly. For instance, these notes are fairly informal as they cater to a student audience. However, that does not mean I devolve into using text speech. Nonetheless, I try to strike a balance between slightly entertaining and factual.

With regards to academic writing many people make the mistake of trying to use, what they consider, sophisticated language. However,simplicity and clarity is key. All that matters is your underlying argument, and supporting evidence. Flavoursome, pretentiousness or inflated language can cloud the underlying purpose of your work. With the idea of simplicity in mind, you can't go too wrong by following George Orwell's rules of writing:

1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
1. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
1. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
1. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.

   <p>
     <em> George Orwell's writing rules - I've abbreviated these so </em>
   </p>

1. Do not use contractions (e.g. don't, can't)
1. Use adverbs and adjectives sparingly - I don't care that you think your project was a **great** success. Or, that a methodology is a **vital** part of a research project.
1. Avoid chatty speech and language - So, basically, I don't want to see this sort of writing, yea!

## Task 1 - Identifying problems with paragraphs

<MuiAlert severity="success">
  <AlertTitle>
    <strong> Task 1  - Obtaining the underlining data </strong>
  </AlertTitle>


Break away in your groups, and based on the key writing points covered above, construct a list of what is wrong with the below excerpt of student work.

- First, you should all, attempt, to read the paragraph - focus on wider structure and form. At this stage, ignore clear grammatical and linguistic errors.
- Next, discuss and construct a list of points for improvement.

<AnswerQuestionDialog
  question={"What is wrong with the paragraph"}
  id={questionIDs.find((q) => q.count === 2).id}

  Identify what is wrong with the below paragraph, a single member from your
  group should summarise the points for improvement (click here to open up the

"Be that as it may, a few issues may emerge while managing the information. For example, dealing with the missing qualities is a troublesome assignment that can be tackled in at any rate. Thus, it requires a bunch of emphasess prior to choosing a last arrangement. Also, exceptions are uproarious qualities inside the dataset.

## Task 2 - Work on your problem statements

<MuiAlert severity="success">
  <AlertTitle>
    <strong> Task 2  - Work on your problem statements</strong>
  </AlertTitle>


A problem statement is, in many ways a perfect paragraph. Consider the following example:

"Scams are prevalent to our every day lives. In the United Kingdom, it has been estimated that scamming causes up to Â£10 billion worth of damage every year (Lonsdale et al. 2016). University students in particular are faced with a variety of scams which can have devastating effects (Metzger, Flanagin and Zwarun 2003). If students were made more aware of the latest scamming tactics, they are less likely to be susceptible to the different scams. This leads me to hypothesise that creating an application to broadcast scams could reduce the effectiveness of these scams"

Above you can see a clear topic statement underpinned by evidence and a conclusion.

<AnswerQuestionDialog
  question={"Share your problem statement"}
  id={questionIDs.find((q) => q.count === 3).id}
>
  For this task, consider assessment 2 which proposes a final year project. Try
  and capture the need for this project through a well constructed problem
  statement. Optionally, share your problem statement.
