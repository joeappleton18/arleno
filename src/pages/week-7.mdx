# Week 7 (How to write propper)

I hope that you agree, communicating clearly and with authority is a vital life skill. However, it is a skill that rarely taught. Also, I have noticed, over time, my students' writing skills have dropped in standard. This may not be surprising, as the majority of your written communication is probably informal (e.g., social media and short messages). I love informal communication; however, it is important to be able to communicate across the spectrum of formality. I know this, as prior to starting my second career as a lecture, I rarely wrote anything formal. I convinced myself that as long as I could be understood, there was little need to worry about writing authoritatively with style and form. Since transitioning back into academia, I have had to learn the skill of crafting well written pieces of work; and I now realise that this skill would have aided me greatly in my pre-university career. As now, I can confidently construct written arguments, and circulate them to whoever can be bothered to read them.

This week I am going to be exploring with you some quick tips that I have learnt over the last 5 years that can drastically improve the quality of your writing. In doing so we are going to be addressing the question:

### How can I construct, clear and concise, written academic arguments.

After this week, you should understand what it means to communicate with clarity. While we will focus on the academic style of writing, the basic tenets can be applied to any form of authoritative writing (e.g., emails, proposals, CVs and Linked in Profiles). 

## Styles of Writing

You may or may not be aware, that there are different styles of writing. Primarily, in your day-to-day life, you'll be exposed to different flavours of journalistic writing (e.g, news, blogs and advertising copy). This styled of writing uses short punchy sentences and paragraphs. The goals of these styles of writing is to draw the readers in with attention grabbing titles, images and headlines.  You'll often find that the paragraphs  and sentences used are short and punchy - to quickly convey information. For instance, it is common to see one sentence paragraphs:

>> As Australia prepares to begin the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, state health departments, including SA Health and Queensland Health, were unable to post.

Academic, writing on the other hand, consists of longer paragraphs. The reason for this is statements made must be underpinned by evidence. 

## Tha Academic paragraph
- A paragraph must represent a single idea
- All sentences relate to one clear idea 
- Each paragraph much fit into a wider flow and argument 
- Normally, the first sentence is a topic sentence 

>> A good scholarly writer is someone who is able to organize their knowledge into paragraph-sized claims and to arrange those claims in a logical and coherent manner so that they add up to a larger point.
