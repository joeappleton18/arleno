    <strong> Tip </strong>
  </AlertTitle>
  For assessment 2, you will need to conduct a literature review, the focus of which
  will be exploring like studies to your project idea. The assessment rests on two
  premises: firstly, you have a project idea and secondly you know how to conduct
  a literature review. The latter point will be worked on in these seminar sessions,
  the former you should be well on your way to achieving, even if it is just a rough
  idea.

In this session we are going to work on the second part of our systematic review process, searching and extracting studies. Hold on, what was the first part? The first part should be developing your problem statement and research question/hypothesis.

### Introduction

Hopefully you know by know that the main focus of the second assessment is to conduct a literature review, the focus of which will be exploring like studies to your project idea. The assessment rests on two premises: firstly, you have a project idea and secondly you know how to conduct a literature review. The latter point will be worked on in these seminar sessions, the former you should be well on your way to achieving, even if it is just a rough idea.

In this session we are going to work on the second part of our systematic review process, searching and extracting studies. Hold on, what was the first part? [The first part should be developing your problem statement and research question/hypothesis](/week-3).

### Activity

This activity consists of a number of steps, you should try and speak to your tutor after each.  
In an ideal world you should have a very rough idea of what you are doing for your final year project. If this is the case this will form the subject of your lit review. If you do not have an idea, just make one up for the sake of this activity.

1. **Getting going** - open up a word/google docs to document your review. Remember, it's systematic, we need to know each step, it must be repeatable this is one of the key tenants of science

2. [Open up the systematic review guidance](/literature-review-protocol#the-review-protocol) . This will act as our notes for today's session.

3. Complete step 1-5 in the [systematic review guidance](/literature-review-protocol#the-review-protocol).

4. By the end of the session you should have a filtered list of studies in a spreadsheet. aim for 5. You will need to tweak your inclusion and exclusion criteria to achieve the correct number. Also, revisiting our evidence pyramid (see below) may be useful at this stage. You are aiming for the top of the pyramid, however if this is not possible you can navigate downwards towards more readily available documents.
