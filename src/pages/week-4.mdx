## Introduction

  For assessment 2, you will need to conduct a literature review, the focus of which
  will be exploring like studies to your project idea. The assessment rests on two
  premises: firstly, you have a project idea and secondly you know how to conduct
  a literature review. The latter point will be worked on in these seminar sessions,
  the former you should be well on your way to achieving, even if it is just a rough
  idea.

In this session we are going to work on the second part of our systematic review process, searching and extracting studies. Hold on, what was the first part? The first part should be developing your problem statement and research question/hypothesis.

## Task 1 - Can swearing really make you stronger

    <strong> Task 1  - Oh ****, swearing can make you stronger </strong>
  </AlertTitle>
  
  Throughout this unit, we are going to be critically exploring scientific papers.  I want to instill you with the skills to be able to interpret science. You can learn these skills through reading scientific papers - as, long as the reported study follows some form of scientific process.


A few weeks ago I was watching "History of Swear Words" on Netflix. While it's not a particularly interesting program, there was a statement that caught my attention. According to a scientist on the show, swearing can reduce pain and make you stronger. It turns out he was correct - well sort of.

There is a paper that suggests this is the case, and today we are going are going to take a look, and address some questions that rise from this paper.

In your groups, open the paper and answer the question (s), that are attached to the sections highlighted.

## Task 2 - Searching for literature

    <strong> Task 2  - Searching for literature </strong>
  </AlertTitle>
  In an ideal world you should have a very rough idea of what you are doing for your final year project. If this is the case this will form the subject of your lit review. If you do not have an idea, just make one up for the sake of this activity.


1. **Getting going** - open up a word/google docs to document your review. Remember, it's systematic, we need to know each step, it must be repeatable this is one of the key tenants of science

2. [Open up the systematic review guidance](/literature-review-protocol#the-review-protocol) . This will act as our notes for today's session.

3. Complete step 1-5 in the [systematic review guidance](/literature-review-protocol#the-review-protocol).

4. By the end of the session you should have a filtered list of studies in a spreadsheet. aim for 5. You will need to tweak your inclusion and exclusion criteria to achieve the correct number. Also, revisiting our evidence pyramid (see below) may be useful at this stage. You are aiming for the top of the pyramid, however if this is not possible you can navigate downwards towards more readily available documents.
