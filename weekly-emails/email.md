### subject: Research Methods (Week 2)
Hello Researchers,

This week we are considering: "what makes a good project?". [To set the scene, I have prepared a 15 minute lecture.](https://solent.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5071a74f-b6d5-438b-8335-ae2f00fffa57) You can access the lecture by clicking the link.  I will also make all the lectures available on the "Course Content Tab" on SOL.

This week is all about what makes a good final year project. You'll spend the majority of the final year doing this project, and it accounts for a large portion of your final year mark! As such this week is going to be important and fun.

See you on Thursday,

Joe

### subject: Research Methods (Week 7)
Hello All,

Welcome to week 7, and a change of topic!

This week, we will transition into our writing and communication topic. Writing, at least clearly, is something many people struggle with. However, with a few tips, itâ€™s possible to make a significant improvement in written communication skills.

Please watch the pre-practical lecture video; it's particularly important: deconstructing what good writing looks like.

Kind Regards,

Joe

### subject: Research Methods (Week 9)

Hello Researchers,

It's the final countdown, we are into the last two weeks of delivered content. 

I am very excited to also announce that we are now starting a learning block: methods. 

Methods are vital in evaluating your final year project; as such, we need to have a basic understanding regarding what they are.

I look forward to seeing you all on Thursday,

Joe
