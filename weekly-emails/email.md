### subject: Research Methods (Week 2)
Hello Researchers,

This week we are considering: "what makes a good project?". [To set the scene, I have prepared a 15 minute lecture.](https://solent.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5071a74f-b6d5-438b-8335-ae2f00fffa57) You can access the lecture by clicking the link.  I will also make all the lectures available on the "Course Content Tab" on SOL.

This week is all about what makes a good final year project. You'll spend the majority of the final year doing this project, and it accounts for a large portion of your final year mark! As such this week is going to be important and fun.

See you on Thursday,

Joe
